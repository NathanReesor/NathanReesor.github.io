CFA Level I candidate. Writing to think clearly and share the work.
about: >-
  I am a Level II CFA candidate focused on investment research, valuation, and
  financial modeling. This space serves as my portfolio and a place to share
  market notes, projects, and lessons along the way, including perspectives on
  Bitcoin and my macro-tourist observations. The last version had merge
  conflicts, so this update clarifies the message.
