  Equity valuation and investment research with a macro lens.
  CFA Level I candidate. Writing to think clearly and share the work.
about: |-
  I’m a CFA Level I candidate focused on investment research and valuation. This
  site is my portfolio of projects and market notes—built to be concise,
  testable, and useful. Outside core equity work, I’m a “macro tourist” by habit:
  I follow cross-asset signals and narratives to sharpen context.

  - Valuation & modeling (DCF, comps, sensitivity/scenarios)
  - Research process (variant view, catalysts, risk framing)
  - Cross-asset context (rates, FX, commodities, crypto)
  - Clear communication: memos, charts, and takeaways
