about: |-
  I’m a CFA Level II candidate focused on investment research and valuation.
  I publish write-ups, models, and notes as I learn in public. I’m a macro tourist in the best sense:
  I explore narratives and data across markets, then translate them into decision-ready insights.

  - Valuation & modeling (DCF, comps, sensitivity/scenarios)
  - Research process (variant view, catalysts, risk framing)
  - Cross-asset context (rates, FX, commodities, crypto)
  - Clear communication: memos, charts, and takeaways
